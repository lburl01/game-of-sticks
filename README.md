## Game of Sticks

**To Run:**
```bash
$ ruby sticks.rb
```

**To Play:**  
Don't be the person who has to take the last stick!

The game will begin by asking for the number of total sticks you and your partner will have to whittle down until one stick remains. You may input a number between 10 and 100.

Once your sticks are "thrown on the table" you and your opponent will alternate selecting whether you will remove 1, 2, or 3 sticks from the pile on the table. You will continue to do this until only one stick remains.

The player who has to pick up the last stick loses!

Good luck!
